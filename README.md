Project to create a 68020 (Amiga 1200) assembly language app  - with the aid of LLM
 - I chose claude for the LLM - proven so far to be very helpful with coding tasks and advise - even on retro ones liek this
 - as little manual/human intervention as possible
 - I would like to be able to push this to a graphical interface - possibly the framework for a game
